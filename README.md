# Remenu-macOS

Remenu for Mac is a small menu bar extension which lets you quickly add new tasks to Apple Reminders. You can invoke Remenu by clicking on its icon in the menu bar or by pressing a customizable keyboard shortcut.

Note: Development of Remenu is paused temporarily due to my personal time limits.
